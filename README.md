## 📖 Overview

**Daily Bread** is a serene, premium digital devotional designed to provide a single moment of reflection each day. In an era of endless scrolling and information overload, Daily Bread embraces the philosophy of **Digital Manna**: just as manna was given for one day only, this application provides one verse for you to carry through your day.

There is no "next" button. We invite you to sit with the text, meditate on it, and let it speak to you.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)
Install Daily Bread on your device for a native-like experience. It works offline, loads instantly, and sits right on your home screen.

### 🎨 Personalization
Make the experience yours with intuitive customization tools:
- **Font Switching**: Choose between elegant Serif (Editorial) or clean Sans-Serif (Inter) typography.
- **Dark Mode**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes, or sync with your system preferences.

### ❤️ Favorites Collection
When a verse resonates with you, save it to your personal **Favorites Collection**. Access your saved verses anytime, even when offline.

### 🔊 Listen & Reflect
Engage with the scripture through audio. The built-in **Text-to-Speech** feature reads the verse aloud, perfect for moments of reflection on the go.
